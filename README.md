# 👋 Welcome

Hi, I’m Mike — a gameplay-focused modder and YouTube content creator.

I try to balance, refine, and overhaul gameplay systems to create deeper, more immersive player experiences. My work often focuses on survival games and sandbox systems, with an emphasis on realism, challenge, and player agency.

I'm currently developing a large-scale gameplay mechanic for *7 Days to Die*, focusing on a new (de)buff system to increase realism and add a little more danger to the gameplay loop.
